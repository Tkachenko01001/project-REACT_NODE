**[Project Task Pro](https://tkachenko01001.github.io/project-REACT_NODE/home)** -
an online tool for managing your projects by creating boards, lists, and cards
that help organize tasks and projects in a visual board format.

**Boards** - are the primary organizational element in project Task Pro, helping
you structure your tasks and projects. A project Task Pro board consists of
lists and cards, aiding in tracking progress, task distribution, and
collaboration with teams.

**Lists** - serve as the core component of a board, assisting in organizing
tasks and other elements. Each project Task Pro board contains one or more
lists, and within each list, there can be various cards.

**Cards** - represent individual items such as tasks, assignments, or other work
units. They constitute the fundamental units of organization on the project Task
Pro board. Each "card" has its own title, description, due date, labels,
comments, and other attributes that aid in task description and management. You
can move cards between lists on your board to indicate their current status.
Cards are highly flexible and can be used for any type of tasks or projects,
from personal to collaborative. They aid in organizing work, storing
information, and tracking progress.

**Due Dates and Notifications:** You can assign due dates (deadlines) to each
card on your board. This allows you to track when specific tasks need to be
completed. As a deadline approaches, project Task Pro can send you
notifications.

**Labels and Colors** - are useful features that help you better organize and
highlight various elements on your board. Here's how these functions work:
Labels are markers that can be added to cards on your board. They help you
classify and group your tasks or items based on specific criteria. For instance,
you can use labels to denote task priorities, task types, or any other
categories relevant to your project. Colors: You can add colored labels to lists
on your board. This visually distinguishes different parts of your work. For
example, you can use different colors for different task types or project
stages. To use labels and colors in project Task Pro, you need to open the
"card" or "list" to which you want to add labels or colors and select the
appropriate markers or colors from the respective menus. This helps you easily
track and recognize different elements on your board.

**Theme Customization:** By changing the theme to one that suits you, you can
emphasize your personal style or preference. Choosing colors, fonts, and other
visual elements helps create a comfortable working environment for you.

**Board Background Changes:** Altering the board's background can help visually
differentiate between various projects or task categories. This is particularly
useful if you have multiple boards for different purposes.
